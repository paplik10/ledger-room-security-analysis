This project documents a comprehensive penetration testing process on a Windows Active Directory environment, specifically targeting Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to achieve Domain Admin privileges.
Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Initial Access
The attack began with user enumeration and credential validation using NetExec (nxc). I focused on identifying potential entry points and checking for unique modules like security questions.
nxc smb 10.48.162.248 -u 'SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT' -p 'CHANGEME2023!' -M security-questions
To visualize the attack path, I deployed BloodHound Community Edition. Encountered several Docker dependency issues, which were resolved by installing docker-compose.
# BloodHound CLI & Environment Setup
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker-compose
sudo ./bloodhound-cli install
