# Active Directory Enumeration & Network Analysis Lab

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this lab is to perform a comprehensive network enumeration on a Windows Domain Controller to identify open ports, active services, and potential attack vectors within an Active Directory environment.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools
- **Tool:** Nmap (Network Mapper)
- **Target IP:** 10.48.162.248
- **OS:** Windows Server (Domain Controller)
- **Strategy:** Conducted a full port scan with service version detection and default script execution to map the attack surface.

## 🔍 Scan Command
```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -A -vv 10.48.162.248 -oN initial_scan.txt

Port	Service	Importance
53	DNS	Essential for domain name resolution and information gathering.
88	Kerberos	Critical for authentication. Target for Kerberoasting and Ticket attacks.
135/445	RPC / SMB	File sharing active. Potential for Null Session or SMB signing attacks.
389	LDAP	Used for user and group enumeration via tools like nxc.
3389	RDP	Remote Desktop Access is enabled; requires monitoring for brute-force attempts
445	SMB over IP	Used for file sharing and Named Pipes. Target for SMB Relay attacks or searching for sensitive files (passwords in scripts).
464	Kerberos Password Change	Used for changing/setting passwords. Can be used for password spraying or brute-forcing accounts.
636	LDAPS (LDAP over SSL)	Secure directory access. If misconfigured, can be used to extract the entire domain database via LDAP signing/relay attacks.
