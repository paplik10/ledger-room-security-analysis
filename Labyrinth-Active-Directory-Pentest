# Internal Active Directory Security Assessment: Labyrinth Domain

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents a simulated internal penetration test of an Active Directory environment. The goal was to identify misconfigurations, perform user enumeration, and map potential attack paths toward Domain Admin privileges.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow

### 1. Reconnaissance & Service Discovery
The assessment began with a full port scan using **Nmap** to identify active services on the target domain controller.
- **Tools:** `Nmap`
- **Key Findings:** Identified DNS (53), HTTP (80), Kerberos (88), LDAP (389), SMB (445), and RDP (3389).

### 2. Initial Access & User Enumeration
I discovered that the LDAP service allowed **Anonymous/Guest Binds**. This enabled the extraction of valid domain usernames without prior authentication.
- **Vulnerability:** Anonymous LDAP Bind
- **Tools:** `NetExec (nxc)`
- **Impact:** Extracted valid users such as `IVY_WILLIS` and `SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT`.

### 3. Credential Validations & SMB Analysis
Using the discovered usernames, a password spray/testing attack was performed.
- **Successful Creds:** `SUSANNA_MCKNIGHT:CHANGEME2023!`
- **Access Level:** Read access to `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON` shares.
- **Observation:** While credentials were valid, the user did not have administrative rights (No Pwn3d! status) or RDP access.

### 4. Domain Mapping (BloodHound)
To identify lateral movement paths, I performed a full domain ingestor execution.
- **Tools:** `bloodhound-python`
- **Stats:** 493 Users, 52 Groups, 2 GPOs found.
- **Output:** JSON files collected for graphical analysis in BloodHound GUI.

## 🛡️ Remediation Recommendations
1. **Disable Anonymous LDAP Binds:** Restrict LDAP queries to authenticated users only.
2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** The use of `CHANGEME2023!` indicates weak credential management.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Audit SMB share permissions to ensure standard users cannot read sensitive GPO scripts.
